# Customer Mall Segmentation

## Introduction

In this project, we will analyze the customer data of a mall and try to segment the customers based on their spending score and annual income. We will use K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customers.

## Dataset

## Requirements
- a) Python 3.7 or above
- b) Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- c) Jupyter Notebook
- d) Basic understanding of K-Means Clustering Algorithm


## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```


## Project Outline
The project will follow the following steps:
1. Importing the libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Visualization
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Model Building
7. Model Evaluation
8. Communicating results
